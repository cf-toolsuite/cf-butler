[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pacphi/cf-butler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pacphi/cf-butler) [![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/pacphi/cf-butler/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/pacphi/cf-butler)

> Status: Incubating

You are a platform operator working for a Fortune 500 enterprise.  You've witnessed first-hand how the product development teams your team supports are super productive; happily invoking `cf push`, `cf cs` and `cf bs` many times per day to deploy applications, create services and bind them to those applications.  

This is great, except that over time, on your non-production foundations, as you've browsed organizations and spaces, you have noticed a large number of stopped application instances and orphaned services (i.e., those not bound to any applications).

Reaching out to each development team to tell them to clean-up has become a chore.  Why not implement some automation that allows you a) to obtain snapshot and usage reports and b) define and enforce some house-keeping policies for your non-production foundations where applications and services are perhaps more volatile?

This is where `cf-butler` has your back.

## What does it do?

Please take 5-10 mintues to view this short video demonstration to get a sense of what `cf-butler` can do.

## Prerequisites

Required

* [Pivotal Application Service](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-application-service) account


## Tools

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 2.20.1 or better
* [JDK](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) 11 or better
* [cf](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) CLI 6.41.0 or better


## Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler.git
```


## How to configure

Make a copy of then edit the contents of the `application.yml` file located in `src/main/resources`.  A best practice is to append a suffix representating the target deployment environment (e.g., `application-pws.yml`, `application-pcfone.yml`). You will need to provide administrator credentials to Apps Manager for the foundation if you want the butler to keep your entire foundation tidy.

> You really should not bundle configuration with the application. To take some of the sting away, you might consider externalizing and/or [encrypting](https://blog.novatec-gmbh.de/encrypted-properties-spring/) this configuration.

### Managing secrets

Place secrets in `config/secrets.json`, e.g.,

```
{
	"CF_API-HOST": "xxxxx",
	"CF_USERNAME": "xxxxx",
	"CF_PASSWORD": "xxxxx"
}
```

We'll use this file later as input configuration for the creation of either a [credhub](https://docs.pivotal.io/credhub-service-broker/using.html) or [user-provided](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html#credentials) service instance.

> Replace occurrences of `xxxxx` above with appropriate values

### Minimum required keys

At a minimum you should supply values for the following keys

* `cf.apiHost` - a Pivotal Application Service API endpoint
* `token.provider` - Authorization token provider, options are: `userpass` or `sso`

Based on choice the authorization token provider

#### Username and password

* `cf.username` - a Pivotal Application Service account username (typically an administrator account)
* `cf.password` - a Pivotal Application Service account password

#### Single-sign on

* `cf.refreshToken` - the refresh token to be found within `~/.cf/config.json` after your authenticate

### General configuration notes

If you copied and appended a suffix to the original `application.yml` then you would set `spring.profiles.active` to be that suffix 

E.g., if you had a configuration file named `application-pws.yml`

```
./gradlew bootRun -Dspring.profiles.active=pws
```

> See the [samples](samples) directory for some examples of configuration when deploying to [Pivotal Web Services](https://login.run.pivotal.io/login) or [PCF One](https://login.run.pcfone.io/login).

### Using an external database

By default `cf-butler` employs an in-memory [H2](http://www.h2database.com) instance.  

If you wish to configure an external database you must set set `spring.r2dbc.*` properties as described [here](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-r2dbc).

Before you `cf push`, stash the credentials for your database in `config/secrets.json` like so

```
{
  "R2DBC_URL": "rdbc:postgresql://<server>:<port>/<database>",
  "R2DBC_USERNAME": "<username>",
  "R2DBC_PASSWORD": "<password>"
}
```

> Replace place-holders encapsulated in `<>` above with real credentials

Or you may wish to `cf bind-service` to a database service instance. In this case you must abide by a naming convention. The name of your service instance must be `cf-butler-backend`.

[DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) scripts for each supported database are managed underneath [src/main/resources/db](src/main/resources/db). Supported databases are: [h2](src/main/resources/db/h2/schema.ddl) and [postgresql](src/main/resources/db/postgresql/schema.ddl).

> A sample [script](deploy.xdb.sh) and [secrets](samples/secrets.pws.json) for deploying `cf-butler` to Pivotal Web Services with an [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) backend exists for your perusal. 

### Managing policies

Creation and deletion of policies are managed via API endpoints by default. When an audit trail is important to you, you may opt to set `cf.policies.provider` to `git`.  When you do this, you shift the lifecycle management of policies to Git.  You will have to specify additional configuration, like

* `cf.policies.uri` the location of the repository that contains policy files in JSON format
* `cf.policies.commit` the commit id to pull from
* `cf.policies.filePaths` an array of file paths of policy files

Policy files must adhere to a naming convention where:

* a filename ending with `-AP.json` encapsulates an individual [ApplicationPolicy](src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/ApplicationPolicy.java)
* a filename ending with `-SIP.json` encapsulates an individual [ServiceInstancePolicy](src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/ServiceInstancePolicy.java)

A sample Github repository exists [here](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler-sample-config).

Have a look at [secrets.pws.json](samples/secrets.pws.json) for an example of how to configure secrets for deployment of `cf-butler` to PAS integrating with the aforementioned sample Github repository.

On startup `cf-butler` will read files from the repo and cache in a database.  Each policy's id will be set to the commit id.

### To set the operations schedule

Update the value of the `cron` properties in `application.yml`.  Consult this [article](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-scheduled-tasks) and the [Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Scheduled.html#cron--) to understand how to tune it for your purposes.  

> `cron` has two sub-properties: `collection` and `execution`.  Make sure `execution` is scheduled to trigger after `collection`.

### Filtering organizations

#### Blacklist

Set `cf.organizationBlackList`.  The `system` organization is excluded by default.

Edit `application.yml` and add

```
cf:
  organizationBlackList:
    - system
```

or

Add an entry in your `config/secrets.json` like

```
  "CF_ORGANIZATION-BLACK-LIST": [ "system" ]
```

#### Whitelist

Within each [ApplicationPolicy](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/ApplicationPolicy.java) or [ServiceInstancePolicy](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/ServiceInstancePolicy.java) you may optionally specify a list of organizations that will be whitelisted.  Policy execution will be restricted to just these organizations in the whitelist.

> If the organization whitelist is not specified in a policy then that policy's execution applies to all organizations on the foundation (except for those in the organization blacklist).


## How to Build

```
./gradlew build
```

> **Note**: as of 2019-03-08 currently embedding implementation borrowed directly from [r2dbc-spi](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi) ([url-parser](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi/tree/url-parser) branch) and [spring-boot-r2dbc](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-r2dbc) projects until updated releases of these artifacts are made publicly available. See this open [issue](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi/issues/37) and [pull-request](https://github.com/r2dbc/r2dbc-spi/pull/48).

## How to Run with Gradle

```
./gradlew bootRun -Dspring.profiles.active={target_foundation_profile}
```
where `{target_foundation_profile}` is something like `pws` or `pcfone`

> You'll need to manually stop to the application with `Ctrl+C`

## How to Run with Docker

You might choose this option when experimenting with an external database provider image like [postgres](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/6c3b27f1433ad81675afb386a182098dc867e3e8/11/alpine/Dockerfile)

Build

```
docker build -t pivotalio/cf-butler:latest .
```

Run

```
docker run -it --rm -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE={env} pivotalio/cf-butler
```
> **Note**: You should have authored an `application-{env}.yml` that encapsulates the appropriate configuration within `src/main/resources` before you built the `cf-butler-{version}-SNAPSHOT.jar` artifact with Gradle

Stop

```
docker ps -a
docker stop {pid}
```
> where `{pid}` is the Docker process id

Cleanup

```
docker rm {pid}
```
> where `{pid}` is the Docker process id


## How to deploy to Pivotal Application Service

### with Username and password authorization

The following instructions explain how to get started when `token.provider` is set to `userpass`

Authenticate to a foundation using the API endpoint.

> E.g., login to [Pivotal Web Services](https://login.run.pivotal.io)

```
cf login -a https://api.run.pivotal.io
```

### with SSO authorization

The following instructions explain how to get started when `token.provider` is set to `sso`

Authenticate to a foundation using the API endpoint

> E.g., login to [PCF One](https://login.run.pcfone.io)

```
cf login -a https://api.run.pcfone.io -sso
```

Visit the link in the password prompt to retrieve a temporary passcode, then complete the login process

> E.g., `https://login.run.pcfone.io/passcode`)

Inspect the contents of `~/.cf/config.json` and copy the value of `RefreshToken`.

Paste the value as the value for `CF_REFRESH-TOKEN` in your `config/secrets.json`

```
{
  "TOKEN_PROVIDER": "sso",
  "CF_API-HOST": "xxxxx",
  "CF_REFRESH-TOKEN": "xxxxx",
}
```

### using scripts

Deploy the app (w/ a user-provided service instance vending secrets)

```
./deploy.sh
```

Deploy the app (w/ a Credhub service instance vending secrets)

```
./deploy.sh --with-credhub
```

Shutdown and destroy the app and service instances

```
./destroy.sh
```
