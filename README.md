You are a platform operator working for a Fortune 500 enterprise.  You've witnessed first-hand how the product development teams your team supports are super productive; happily invoking `cf push`, `cf create-service` and `cf bind-service` many times per day to deploy applications, create services and bind them to those applications.

This is great, except that over time, on your non-production foundations, as you've browsed organizations and spaces, you have noticed a large number of stopped application instances and orphaned services (i.e., those not bound to any applications).

Reaching out to each development team to tell them to clean-up has become a chore.  Why not implement some automation that allows you a) to obtain snapshot and usage reports and b) define and enforce some house-keeping policies for your non-production foundations where applications and services are perhaps more volatile and c) easily handle multi-organization or system-wide use-cases like application instance scaling or stack changes?

This is where `cf-butler` has your back.

## What does it do?

Please take 5-10 mintues to view this short video demonstration to get a sense of what `cf-butler` can do.

### Tell me, don't show me

Cf-butler exposes a number of self-service endpoints that perform house-keeping for your foundation.  You define policies and an execution schedule.  E.g., applications and service instances could be removed based on policy crtieria.  Cf-butler also provides detail and summary snapshot reporting on all applications, service instances, user accounts, organizations and spaces.  Lastly, cf-butler [aspires](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/issues/62) to provide operators insight into the "freshness" of installed tiles, stemcells and buildpacks.

### And what about Pivotal Telemetry Collector?

[Pivotal Telemetry Collector](https://docs.pivotal.io/telemetry/1-0/index.html) supports collection of configuration data from Operations Manager, certificate data from Credhub, and usage data from Pivotal Application Service.  Customers download and install a [CLI](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-telemetry-collector/) from Pivotal Network.  Typically, a [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org) [pipeline](https://docs.pivotal.io/telemetry/1-0/using-concourse.html) is configured to automate collection.  The result of collection is a foundation details [tarball](https://docs.pivotal.io/telemetry/1-0/data.html#collected). Customers may opt to transmit this data to Pivotal.

Telemetry is also available for [PCF Dev](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-dev/telemetry.html) and [Pivotal Container Service](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-4/telemetry.html).

> Note: the [Pivotal Telemetry]((https://pivotal.io/legal/telemetry)) program is opt-in.

Cf-butler is configured and deployed as an application instance. Its capabilities overlap only on usage data collection from Pivotal Application Service.  However, cf-butler performs other useful duties like a) snapshot usage reporting and b) policy registration and execution.


## Prerequisites

Required

* Access to a foundation with Pivotal Application Service 2.6 or better installed
  * and [Pivotal Application Service](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-application-service) admin account credentials

Optional

* [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) account credentials
* [Pivotal Operations Manager](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-components/pcf-ops-manager) admin account credentials


## Tools

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 2.20.1 or better
* [JDK](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) 11 or better
* [cf](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) CLI 6.41.0 or better
* [uaac](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac) 4.1.0 or better


## Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler.git
```


## How to configure

Make a copy of then edit the contents of the `application.yml` file located in `src/main/resources`.  A best practice is to append a suffix representating the target deployment environment (e.g., `application-pws.yml`, `application-pcfone.yml`). You will need to provide administrator credentials to Apps Manager for the foundation if you want the butler to keep your entire foundation tidy.

> You really should not bundle configuration with the application. To take some of the sting away, you might consider externalizing and/or [encrypting](https://blog.novatec-gmbh.de/encrypted-properties-spring/) this configuration.

### Managing secrets

Place secrets in `config/secrets.json`, e.g.,

```
{
  "PIVNET_API-TOKEN": "xxxxx"
  "CF_API-HOST": "xxxxx",
  "CF_USERNAME": "xxxxx",
  "CF_PASSWORD": "xxxxx",
}
```

We'll use this file later as input configuration for the creation of either a [credhub](https://docs.pivotal.io/credhub-service-broker/using.html) or [user-provided](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html#credentials) service instance.

> Replace occurrences of `xxxxx` above with appropriate values

### Minimum required keys

At a minimum you should supply values for the following keys

* `cf.apiHost` - a Pivotal Application Service API endpoint
* `cf.tokenProvider` - Pivotal Application Service authorization token provider, options are: `userpass` or `sso`
* `pivnet.apiToken` - a Pivotal Network legacy API Token, visit your [profile](https://network.pivotal.io/users/dashboard/edit-profile)

Based on choice of the authorization token provider

#### Username and password

* `cf.username` - a Pivotal Application Service account username (typically an administrator account)
* `cf.password` - a Pivotal Application Service account password

#### Single-sign on

* `cf.refreshToken` - the refresh token to be found within `~/.cf/config.json` after your authenticate

### General configuration notes

If you copied and appended a suffix to the original `application.yml` then you would set `spring.profiles.active` to be that suffix

E.g., if you had a configuration file named `application-pws.yml`

```
./gradlew bootRun -Dspring.profiles.active=pws
```

> See the [samples](samples) directory for some examples of configuration when deploying to [Pivotal Web Services](https://login.run.pivotal.io/login) or [PCF One](https://login.run.pcfone.io/login).

For an exhaustive listing of all overridable configuration properties consult [ButlerCfEnvProcessor.java](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/config/ButlerCfEnvProcessor.java).

### Using an external database

By default `cf-butler` employs an in-memory [H2](http://www.h2database.com) instance.

If you wish to configure an external database you must set set `spring.r2dbc.*` properties as described [here](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-r2dbc).

Before you `cf push`, stash the credentials for your database in `config/secrets.json` like so

```
{
  "R2DBC_URL": "rdbc:postgresql://<server>:<port>/<database>",
  "R2DBC_USERNAME": "<username>",
  "R2DBC_PASSWORD": "<password>"
}
```

> Replace place-holders encapsulated in `<>` above with real credentials

Or you may wish to `cf bind-service` to a database service instance. In this case you must abide by a naming convention. The name of your service instance must be `cf-butler-backend`.

[DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) scripts for each supported database are managed underneath [src/main/resources/db](src/main/resources/db). Supported databases are: [h2](src/main/resources/db/h2/schema.ddl), [mysql](src/main/resources/db/mysql/schema.ddl) and [postgresql](src/main/resources/db/postgresql/schema.ddl).

> A sample [script](scripts/deploy.postgres.sh) and [secrets](samples/secrets.pws.with-postgres.json) for deploying `cf-butler` to Pivotal Web Services with an [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) backend exists for your perusal.  If you're rather interested in MySQL as a backend, take a look at this version of [secrets](samples/secrets.pws.with-mysql.json) and the accompanying [script](scripts/deploy.mysql.sh).

### Managing policies

Creation and deletion of policies are managed via API endpoints by default. When an audit trail is important to you, you may opt to set `cf.policies.git.uri` -- this property specifies the location of the repository that contains policy files in JSON format.

When you do this, you shift the lifecycle management of policies to Git.  You will have to specify additional configuration, like

* `cf.policies.git.commit` the commit id to pull from
  * if this property is missing the latest commit will be used
* `cf.policies.git.filePaths` an array of file paths of policy files

If you want to work with a private repository, then you will have to specify

* `cf.policies.git.username`
* `cf.policies.git.password`

one or both are used to authenticate.  In the case where you may have configured a personal access token, set `cf.policies.git.username` equal to the value of the token.

Policy files must adhere to a naming convention where:

* a filename ending with `-AP.json` encapsulates an individual [ApplicationPolicy](src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/ApplicationPolicy.java)
* a filename ending with `-SIP.json` encapsulates an individual [ServiceInstancePolicy](src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/ServiceInstancePolicy.java)

A sample Github repository exists [here](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler-sample-config).

Have a look at [secrets.pws.json](samples/secrets.pws.json) for an example of how to configure secrets for deployment of `cf-butler` to PAS integrating with the aforementioned sample Github repository.

On startup `cf-butler` will read files from the repo and cache in a database.  Each policy's id will be set to the commit id.

#### Hygiene Policies

Hygiene policies are useful when you want to search for and report on dormant workloads, notifying both the operator and for each workload the author and/or his/her space compadres.  Workloads are running applications and service instances that have not been updated in N or more days from the date/time of the policy execution.

> Note: hygiene policy configuration has a special case where if the `days-since-last-update` property value is set to `-1` then ALL workloads (minus the blacklist) are included in the respective notifications.

As mentioned previously the policy file must adhere to a naming convention

* a filename ending with `-HP.json` encapsulates an individual [HygienePolicy](src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/HygienePolicy.java)

See additional property requirements in Query policies and the aforementioned sample Github repository.


#### Legacy Policies

Legacy policies are useful when you want to search for and report on applications deployed to a legacy stack (e.g., windows2012R2, cflinuxfs2) or service offering (e.g., using a product slug name like p-config-server, p-service-registry, p-mysql), notifying both the operator and for each application the author and/or his/her space compadres.

As mentioned previously the policy file must adhere to a naming convention

* a filename ending with `-LP.json` encapsulates an individual [LegacyPolicy](src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/LegacyPolicy.java)

See additional property requirements in Query policies and the aforementioned sample Github repository.


#### Endpoint Policies

Endpoint policies are useful when you want to exercise any of the available GET endpoints and have the results sent to one or more designated email recipients.

As mentioned previously the policy file must adhere to a naming convention

* a filename ending with `-EP.json` encapsulates an individual [EndpointPolicy](src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/EndpointPolicy.java)

See additional property requirements in Query policies and the aforementioned sample Github repository.


#### Query policies

Query policies are useful when you want to step out side the canned snapshot reporting capabilties and leverage the underlying [schema](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/tree/master/src/main/resources/db) to author one or more of your own queries and have the results delivered as comma-separated value attachments using a defined email notification [template](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/EmailNotificationTemplate.java).

As mentioned previously the policy file must adhere to a naming convention

* a filename ending with `-QP.json` encapsulates an individual [QueryPolicy](src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/QueryPolicy.java)

If you intend to deploy query policies you must also configure the `notification.engine` property.  You can define it in your

application-{env}.yml

```
notification:
  engine: <engine>
```

or

secrets-{env}.json

```
  "NOTIFICATION_ENGINE": "<engine>"
```

> Replace `<engine>` above with one of either `java-mail`, or `sendgrid`

Furthermore, you will need to define additional properties depending on which engine you chose.  Checkout [application.yml](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yml) to get to know what they are.

E.g, if you intended to use [sendgrid](https://www.sendgrid.com) as your email notification engine then your secrets-{env}.yml might contain

```
  "NOTIFICATION_ENGINE": "sendgrid",
  "SENDGRID_API-KEY": "replace_me"
```

### To set the operations schedule

Update the value of the `cron` properties in `application.yml`.  Consult this [article](https://riptutorial.com/spring/example/21209/cron-expression) and the [Javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Scheduled.html#cron--) to understand how to tune it for your purposes.

> `cron` has two sub-properties: `collection` and `execution`.  Make sure `execution` is scheduled to trigger after `collection`.

### To discriminate user from service accounts

Consult [PasSettings.java](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/config/PasSettings.java#L25) for the default pattern value used to discriminate between user and service accounts.  You may override the default by adding to

* application.yml

  ```
  cf:
    accountRegex: "some other pattern"
  ```

or

* config/secrets.json

  ```
  {
    "CF_ACCOUNT-REGEX": "some other pattern"
  }
  ```

### Filtering organizations

#### Blacklist

Set `cf.organizationBlackList`.  The `system` organization is excluded by default.

Edit `application.yml` and add

```
cf:
  organizationBlackList:
    - system
```

or

Add an entry in your `config/secrets.json` like

```
  "CF_ORGANIZATION-BLACK-LIST": [ "system" ]
```

#### Whitelist

Within each [ApplicationPolicy](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/ApplicationPolicy.java), [ServiceInstancePolicy](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/ServiceInstancePolicy.java), or [HygienePolicy](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/HygienePolicy.java) you may optionally specify a list of organizations that will be whitelisted.  Policy execution will be restricted to just these organizations in the whitelist.

> If the organization whitelist is not specified in a policy then that policy's execution applies to all organizations on the foundation (except for those in the organization blacklist).

### Integration w/ Operations Manager

You must add the following configuration properties to `application-{env}.yml` if you want to enable integration with an operations manager instance

* `om.apiHost` - a Pivotal Operations Manager API endpoint
* `om.enabled` - a boolean property that must be set to `true`

> the `{env}` filename suffix above denotes the Spring Profile you would activate for your environment

or

Add entries in your `config/secrets.json` like

```
  "OM_API-HOST": "xxxxxx",
  "OM_ENABLED": true
```

## How to Build

```
./gradlew build
```

### Alternative build with MySQL support

If you want to target a MySQL database as your back-end you will need to use an alternate Gradle build file.  It adds a dependency on [r2dbc-mysql](https://github.com/mirromutth/r2dbc-mysql) which is sourced from a [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io/#mirromutth/r2dbc-mysql/master-SNAPSHOT) repository.

```
./gradlew build -b build.w-mysql.gradle
```

## How to Run with Gradle

```
./gradlew bootRun -Dspring.profiles.active={target_foundation_profile}
```
where `{target_foundation_profile}` is something like `pws` or `pcfone`

> You'll need to manually stop to the application with `Ctrl+C`

## How to Run with Docker

You might choose this option when experimenting with an external database provider image like [postgres](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/6c3b27f1433ad81675afb386a182098dc867e3e8/11/alpine/Dockerfile) or [mysql](https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/blob/26380f33a0fcd07dda35e37516eb24eaf962845c/5.7/Dockerfile)

Build

```
docker build -t pivotalio/cf-butler:latest .
```

Run

Start database

```
docker run --name butler-mysql -e MYSQL_DATABASE=butler -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd! -e MYSQL_USER=butler -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:5.7.26
```
> MySQL

or

```
docker run --name butler-postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=butler -e POSTGRES_USER=butler -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:11.4
```
> PostgreSQL


Start application

```
docker run -it --rm -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE={env} pivotalio/cf-butler
```
> **Note**: You should have authored an `application-{env}.yml` that encapsulates the appropriate configuration within `src/main/resources` before you built the `cf-butler-{version}-SNAPSHOT.jar` artifact with Gradle

Stop

```
docker ps -a
docker stop {pid}
```
> where `{pid}` is a Docker process id

Cleanup

```
docker rm {pid}
```
> where `{pid}` is the Docker process id


## How to deploy to Pivotal Application Service

### with Username and password authorization

The following instructions explain how to get started when `cf.tokenProvider` is set to `userpass`

Authenticate to a foundation using the API endpoint.

> E.g., login to [Pivotal Web Services](https://login.run.pivotal.io)

```
cf login -a https://api.run.pivotal.io
```

### with SSO authorization

The following instructions explain how to get started when `cf.tokenProvider` is set to `sso`

Authenticate to a foundation using the API endpoint

> E.g., login to [PCF One](https://login.run.pcfone.io)

```
cf login -a https://api.run.pcfone.io -sso
```

Visit the link in the password prompt to retrieve a temporary passcode, then complete the login process

> E.g., `https://login.run.pcfone.io/passcode`)

Inspect the contents of `~/.cf/config.json` and copy the value of `RefreshToken`.

Paste the value as the value for `CF_REFRESH-TOKEN` in your `config/secrets.json`

```
{
  "CF_TOKEN-PROVIDER": "sso",
  "CF_API-HOST": "xxxxx",
  "CF_REFRESH-TOKEN": "xxxxx",
}
```

### using scripts

Please review the [manifest.yml](manifest.yml) before deploying.

Deploy the app (w/ a user-provided service instance vending secrets)

```
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

Deploy the app (w/ a Credhub service instance vending secrets)

```
./scripts/deploy.sh --with-credhub
```

Shutdown and destroy the app and service instances

```
./scripts/destroy.sh
```

> Note: If you are seeing [OutOfMemory exceptions](https://dzone.com/articles/troubleshooting-problems-with-native-off-heap-memo) shortly after startup you may need to [cf scale](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/cf-scale.html#vertical) the available memory for large foundations.

## Endpoints

These REST endpoints have been exposed for reporting and administrative purposes.

### Operations Manager

These endpoints are only available when the `om.enabled` property is set to `true`. `om.apiHost`, `om.username` and `om.password` properties must also have been defined.  Mimics a reduced set of the [Operations Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/opsman-api/).

```
GET /products/deployed
```
> List of all tiles installed on foundation.

```
GET /products/stemcell/assignments
```
> Lists all stemcells associated with installed tiles (includes staged and available stemcell versions).

```
GET /products/stemcell/associations
```
> Lists all stemcells associated with installed tiles (includes staged and available stemcell versions).
> Only available from Operations Manager 2.6.0 onward.

```
GET /products/om/info
```
> Returns the current version of the Operations Manager instance

```
GET /products/metrics
```
> Returns release metric information for installed products (includes buildpacks, stemcells and tiles).  Note: stemcell release metrics are only available from foundations administered with Ops Manager 2.6 or later.

### Pivotal Network

These endpoints are only available when the `pivnet.enabled` property is set to `true`. A valid `pivnet.apiToken` property must also have been defined.  Mimics a reduced set of the [Pivotal Network API](https://network.pivotal.io/docs/api).

```
GET /store/product/catalog
```
> Retrieves a list of all products from Pivotal Network (includes buildpacks, stemcells and tiles)

```
GET /store/product/releases?q=latest
```
> Returns a list of the latest available releases for all products on Pivotal Network (includes buildpacks, stemcells and tiles)

```
GET /store/product/releases?q=all
```
> Returns a list of all available releases for all products on Pivotal Network (includes buildpacks, stemcells and tiles)

```
GET /store/product/releases?q=recent
```
> Returns a list of releases released within the last 7 days for all products on Pivotal Network (includes buildpacks, stemcells and tiles)


### Events

Based off the [Events API](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/287/events/list_all_events.html) and exposed only when the `spring.profiles.active` includes the `on-demand` profile.

```
GET /events/{id}
```
> Returns the last 10 events for an actee guid (e.g., application, service instance)

```
GET /events/{id}?numberOfEvents={n}
```
> Returns n events (up to a maximum of 250) for an actee guid (e.g., application, service instance)

```
GET /events/{id}?types[]={type1,type2,...,typen}
```
> Returns matching events for an actee guid (e.g., application, service instance).  An comma-separated array of valid event types must be specified.


### Metadata

Metadata is comprised of [labels](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.76.0/index.html#labels-and-selectors) and/or [annotations](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.76.0/index.html#annotations).  Labels work with selectors to subsequently help you lookup resources.

```
GET /metadata/{type}/{id}
```
> Return resource with id, created date, last updated date, and associated metadata; where `{type}` is the id field of a [ResourceType](https://github.com/pacphi/cf-butler/blob/master/src/main/java/io/pivotal/cfapp/domain/ResourceType.java) enum and `{id}` is the guid of a resource.

```
PATCH /metadata/{type}/{id}
```
> Update metadata associated with a resource id

Sample body

```
{
    "metadata": {
        "labels": {
        	"cost-center": "11009872"
        },
        "annotations": {
        	"region": "us-west2"
        }
    }
}

### Snapshot

```
GET /snapshot/organizations
```
> Lists organizations

```
GET /snapshot/organizations/count
```
> Counts the number of organizations on a foundation

```
GET /snapshot/spaces/users
```
> Provides details and light metrics for users by role within all organizations and spaces on a foundation
